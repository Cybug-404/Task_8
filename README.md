# Task_8 Working with VPNs

## üîç Objective
 Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication
 
## üõ† Tools Used
- Chrome (Browser)
- Hotspot Shield VPN
- Windows (OS)

## üß™ Steps Performed
1. Install Hotspot shield from **www.hotspotshield.com**
2. Note down current ip address 
3. Change the vpn location and browse
4. Verify the ip address (whatismyipaddress.com)
5. Encrypted data traffic
6. Analyzed Internet speed before and after VPN connection 


## üìä Output
- VPN helps to encryt user data traffic
- Able to access different locations websites
- Provide anonymousity


## üß† Learnings
  A **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** is a service that creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device and the internet. It hides your IP address, protects your data, and lets you access content from restricted by location. VPN like Express VPNs provide high level encryption and secure but some public vpns are not that much secure and easy to crack the encryption. Some VPN providers are NordVPN, ExpressVPN, surfshark, Hotshield, Proton, Turbovpn, CyberGhost etc.
  
 ### VPN Encryption Levels
  Encryption is how VPNs secure your data, making it unreadable to others.
  1. AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard ‚Äì 256 bit)
    - Extremely strong; used by militaries and governments.
    - Most VPNs use this as the default for maximum protection.
    - Slightly slower due to heavy encryption, but very secure.
 
  2. AES-128
    - Still very secure, practically unbreakable.
    - Preferred for better speed with sufficient security.
    - Faster than AES-256, uses less CPU.
 
  3. ChaCha20
    - Modern, secure cipher often used with mobile VPNs.
    - Excellent for mobile apps or older devices.
    - Faster than AES on devices without hardware acceleration.

 ### VPN Privacy Features 
   DNS Leak Protection
    Problem: Without this, DNS requests might go through your ISP instead of the VPN, revealing browsing activity.
    Solution: VPN ensures DNS requests are encrypted and routed through its secure servers.

   Obfuscation (Stealth Mode)
    Purpose: Makes VPN traffic look like regular internet traffic to bypass VPN blocks (e.g., in China or school networks).
    How: Uses obfuscation protocols like XOR or Stunnel to hide VPN use.
  
   Split Tunneling
    Function: Lets you choose which apps/websites use the VPN and which use your regular connection.
    Benefit: Useful for accessing local services while remaining anonymous elsewhere.

   Multi-Hop (Double VPN)
    How it works: Routes your traffic through two or more VPN servers.
    Advantage: Adds another layer of security, making it even harder to trace activity.
 
   IPv6 Leak Protection
    Why needed: Some ISPs support IPv6, which may bypass the VPN if not blocked.
    VPN‚Äôs role: Disables or tunnels IPv6 traffic to prevent leaks.

 ### VPN Advantage:
  - Hides your IP address and encrypts traffic.
  - Prevents data theft on open networks.
  - Access content blocked in your region.
  - Helps maintain online anonymity.
  - Encrypts sensitive data during transmission.

### VPN Disadvantage:
  - Due to encryption and rerouting.
  - VPN providers may keep logs.
  - Some websites detect and block VPNs.
  - Reliable VPNs are usually paid.
  - Security depends on the VPN provider‚Äôs policies.
