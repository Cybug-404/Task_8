1. What is a VPN?
   A VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device and the internet, masking your IP and protecting your data.

2. How does a VPN protect privacy?
   It hides your real IP address, encrypts internet traffic, and prevents ISPs or hackers from tracking your online activity.

3. Difference between VPN and proxy?
   A proxy only hides your IP address without encryption, while a VPN encrypts all traffic and provides better security.

4. What is encryption in VPN?
   Encryption converts your data into unreadable code during transmission, protecting it from unauthorized access.

5. Can VPN guarantee complete anonymity?
   No, VPNs improve privacy but don’t offer full anonymity—providers may log activity, and websites can still track you via cookies or fingerprinting.

6. What protocols do VPNs use?
   Common protocols: OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2/IPSec, L2TP/IPSec, and PPTP.

7. What are some VPN limitations?
   Reduced speed, potential logging by providers, blocked by some services, and not fully anonymous.

8. How does a VPN affect network speed?
   It may slow down the connection due to encryption and rerouting through remote servers.
